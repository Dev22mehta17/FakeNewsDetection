Fake News Detection Model project of ml
This project involves developing a fake news detection model that leverages logistic regression and decision tree classifiers for traditional machine learning approaches, combined with transformers for advanced natural language understanding. This hybrid approach aims to enhance accuracy by blending interpretable models with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
